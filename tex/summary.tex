\section{Summary}
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have made previously intractable tasks such as image classification and automated language translation accessible to effective computational solutions. ANN with high potential for irregular refinement are highly desirable because they serve as a springboard for techniques such as direct-encoded evolutionary search or backpropagation. This project will investigate how phenotypic plasticity might bias evolutionary search towards networks with high potential for irregular refinement with the ultimate goal of developing methodology to promote the evolution of such networks.
