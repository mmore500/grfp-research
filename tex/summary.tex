\section{Summary}

My research aims to characterize evolutionary bias towards artificial neural architectures with high irregular refinement potential induced by varied methods of local phenotypic search, specifically considering (1) the organization of local phenotypic search, the degree to which that search is biased by distribution of fitness over the local phenotypic space, and (2) selective preference for characteristics of local phenotypic space, the degree to which the presence of fitness peaks is preferred over the overall fitness of the local phenotypic neighborhood. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop methodology to promote the evolution of neural architectures that, irrespective of pre-refinement fitness, give rise to highly fit neural networks via irregular refinement.
