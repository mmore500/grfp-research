\section{Summary}

Deep learning techniques require users to define a domain-specific model architecture, which are increasingly time-consuming and difficult to design manually.
I will extend existing, successful evolutionary approaches to automatic generation of deep learning architectures.
By incorporating developmental plasticity into the evolution of deep learning architectures, I will develop techniques to evolve more effective, compact, and versatile DNN architecture with greater computational efficiency than existing approaches.
