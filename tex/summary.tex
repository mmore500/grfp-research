\section{Summary}
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have provided computational means to address previously intractable tasks such as image classification and automated language translation.
ANNs with high potential for irregular refinement are highly desirable because they serve as a springboard for existing techniques such as direct-encoded evolutionary search or backpropagation.
This project will investigate how phenotypic plasticity might bias evolutionary search toward networks with high potential for irregular refinement.
This work aims to develop methodology to evolve such networks.
