\section{Broader Impact}

Developing neural systems with multiple levels of adaptivity --- development and learning, in addition to evolution --- is considered a major goal of EANN research \cite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems}. This research, which probes the relationships between evolution and learning potential, will contribute to the ongoing development of this next generation of EANN and, ultimately, contribute to the march of EANN towards scale and plasticity rivaling those of their biological counterparts \cite{Clune2011OnRegularity,Tonelli2013OnNetworks}. The potential human impact of such advances is difficult to overstate. Evolving artificial neural networks are already exploited to commercial ends  in industry by pioneering firms such as Sentient Technologies, which is employing EANN in ecommerce and finance; as EANN frameworks become more capable and the cost of parallel computing power continues to decrease, applications of EANN will continue to ripen. Evolving artificial neural networks promise to offer capabilities distinct from the current standard of neural network training methodology in industry. Unlike training by backpropagation, evolving neural networks are suited to problem domains that are not amenable to supervised learning such as robotics (i.e. grasping, bipedal walking, etc.) \cite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems}. Additionally, EANN provide a route towards ANN with the potential for online learning \cite{Tonelli2013OnNetworks}. The introduction these capabilities will unleash a deluge of novel applications for ANN. Commercialization of EANN, which is already underway and will be further enabled by theoretical and methodological advances by researchers developing the next generation of EANN, promises to translate into tangible, pervasive, and profoundly innovative products and services.


% This research is especially applicable in terms of evolving EANN that can take advantage of potential for lifetime irregular refinement. As EANN become more capable and the cost of parallel computing power continues to decrease, EANN  will become ripe for applications in the technology sector. Commercial pioneers, such as  Sentient Technologies, are already investigating applications of EANN in fields such as e-commerce and finance [cite]. 

% EANN have the potential to offer capabilities distinct from neural network technology currently standard in industry. In particular, the capability to train networks to do complex tasks that are not well suited to supervised learning and the potential for online learning in these systems  \cite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems} means the potential for systems that can interface socially with people. The disruptive products that EANN will lead to are difficult to predict, but they might include ... . Commercialization of EANN, which will be accelerated by theoretical and methodological advances by EANN researchers, promises to make the unique capabilities of   consumers benefit from the unique capabilities offered by EANN. .
