\section{Broader Impact}

Developing neural systems with multiple levels of adaptivity --- development and learning, in addition to evolution --- is considered a major goal of EANN research \autocite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems}. By probing the relationship between evolution and learning potential, this research will contribute to the ongoing development of this next generation of EANN. Today, EANN see commercial applications in sectors including finance and ecommerce; applications will continue to ripen as EANN mature. EANN offer capabilities radically different from currently existing systems; evolving neural networks are suited to problem domains that are not amenable to supervised learning such as robotics (i.e. grasping, bipedal walking, etc.) \autocite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems} and can naturally be extended to perform online learning \autocite{Tonelli2013OnNetworks}. The next generation of EANN promises to translate into tangible, pervasive, and profoundly innovative products and services.


% This research is especially applicable in terms of evolving EANN that can take advantage of potential for lifetime irregular refinement. As EANN become more capable and the cost of parallel computing power continues to decrease, EANN  will become ripe for applications in the technology sector. Commercial pioneers, such as  Sentient Technologies, are already investigating applications of EANN in fields such as e-commerce and finance [autocite]. 

% EANN have the potential to offer capabilities distinct from neural network technology currently standard in industry. In particular, the capability to train networks to do complex tasks that are not well suited to supervised learning and the potential for online learning in these systems  \autocite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems} means the potential for systems that can interface socially with people. The disruptive products that EANN will lead to are difficult to predict, but they might include ... . Commercialization of EANN, which will be accelerated by theoretical and methodological advances by EANN researchers, promises to make the unique capabilities of   consumers benefit from the unique capabilities offered by EANN. .
