\section{Broader Impact}

This research will contribute to the march of EANN towards networks with the size and plasticity rivaling those of their biological counterparts \cite{Clune2011OnRegularity,Tonelli2013OnNetworks}. This research is especially applicable in terms of evolving EANN that can take advantage of potential for lifetime irregular refinement. As EANN become more capable and the cost of parallel computing power continues to decrease, the EANN will become ripe for applications in the technology sector. Commercial pioneers, such as the recently founded Sentient Technologies, are already employing . This means that consumers benefit from the unique capabilities offered by EANN. In particular, the capability to train networks to do complex tasks that are not well suited to supervised learning and the potential for online learning in these systems  \cite{Downing2015IntelligenceSystems} means the potential for systems that can interface socially with people. The disruptive products are difficult to predict, but they will surely have a massive lifestyle impact.

\begin{itemize}
  \item artificial intelligence has direct applications to technology; stronger artificial intelligence has the potential to allow people to more fully exercise their human capacities
  \item EANN techniques are starting to be used in industry (i.e. Sentient AI)
  \item need to be more specific...
\end{itemize}
