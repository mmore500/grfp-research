\section{Impact}

Results from  describing evolutionary bias induced by representative and elitist models of phenotypic plasticity will directly inform important and active conversations taking place among evolutionary theorists.
Its intellectual impact field of evolutionary biology, which is grappling with the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution theory as it undergoes a paradigm shift in evolution theory from the Modern Synthesis to the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, as well as to the field of evolutionary computinmg.\autocite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}

In addition to contributing to the scientific discussion, I aim to use this work to contribute to the scientific community by bringing other students, especially those facing barriers to involvement in science, into the project.
I anticipate working with an undergraduate student to execute the high-performance computing aspects of the project.
Additionally, this work will both leverage and contribute to the AVIDA-ED platform to engage younger students in scientific inquiry.

By developing techniques to evolve ANN with high irregular refinement potential to serve as a platform for further optimization via irregular refinement, this research will also yield utility in applied contexts.
The possibility of evolving neural topologies that boost the performance of backpropagation training, a powerful network algorithm that enjoys extensive use, is particularly exciting.
This research will contribute to the avalanche of tangible, pervasive, and profoundly innovative products and services unleashed by advances in artificial intelligence.
