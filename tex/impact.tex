\section{Broader Impacts}

I aim to \textbf{make powerful deep learning methods accessible to non-experts} by using NGS to reduce the computational cost of evolving deep learning architectures.
Partnering with industry will enable my work to help solve real-world problems by removing barriers to the development of new AI products and services.

I plan to \textbf{work with undergraduate researchers to demonstrate applications of deep learning architectures evolved with NGS} in natural language processing, computer vision, and game-playing agents and \textbf{create interactive web media to showcase their work to the general public}.
The appealing, concrete nature of these applications and \textbf{funding through NSF BEACON}, which places dozens of underrepresented students into evolution-focused research laboratories every summer, will help us recruit from a broad spectrum of students.
