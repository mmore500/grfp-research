\section{Impact}

This research will contribute to the theoretical framework of EANN by probing a poorly characterized evolutionary mechanism, the Baldwin effect.
Its intellectual impact will extend to the field of evolutionary biology, which is grappling with the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution theory as it undergoes a paradigm shift in evolution theory from the Modern Synthesis to the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.\autocite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}
Results describing evolutionary bias induced by representative and elitist models of phenotypic plasticity will directly inform these important conversations.

By developing techniques to evolve ANN with high irregular refinement potential to serve as a platform for further optimization via irregular refinement, this research will yield utility in applied contexts.
The possibility of evolving neural topologies that boost the performance of backpropagation training, a powerful network algorithm that enjoys extensive use, is particularly exciting.
By probing the relationship between learning and evolution, this research will support the development of neural systems with online learning capabilities, ripening EANN for more extensive applied use.
This research will contribute to the avalanche of tangible, pervasive, and profoundly innovative products and services unleashed by advances in artificial intelligence.
