\section{Intellectual Impact}

By considering irregular refinement as a model of learning, this research applies an existing toolkit (based on the work of Clune et al.) to investigate the Baldwin effect;
it represents a novel link between to previously separate lines of EANN research.\autocite{Clune2011OnRegularity,Downing2010TheNetworks}

The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolutionary theory is central to debate over the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, the controversial doctrine that proponents claim add vital explanatory power to the existing Modern Synthesis.\autocite{Laland2014DoesRethink}
Results describing evolutionary bias induced by representative and elitist models of phenotypic plasticity will directly inform these important ongoing conversations.

\section{Broader Impacts}

The techniques we develop to evolve HPFIR ANNs will also be useful outside academic research.
The possibility of evolving neural topologies that act as a springboard to boost deep learning is particularly exciting; this research will contribute to the innovative products and services being unleashed by advances in artificial intelligence.
The work will yield practical contributions to the scientific community, as well.
I will implement computational experiments using the Modular Agent Based Evolution Framework (MABE) to enable easy plug-and-play reuse by other researchers \autocite{Hintze2017Mabe}.
The techniques for evolving HPFIR ANN developed through this project are naturally extensible to many problem domains, such as robot control, computer vision, and game-playing agents
I plan to work with undergraduate researchers to demonstrate applications of such evolved networks and exploit Empirical to develop a web-based tool to evolve HPFIR ANN and export those networks in formats compatible with existing deep learning frameworks, (including Caffe, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch) for further refinement.
The appealing and concrete nature of these application areas will help us to recruit from a broad spectrum of undergraduate students.
I will pursue support through the NSF BEACON Center, which places dozens of underrepresented undergraduate students into evolution-focused research laboratories every summer, for an undergraduate research assistant.
