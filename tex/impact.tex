\section{Broader Impacts}

My work will boost automatic design of deep learning architectures, a high-priority problem in AI industry.
I aim to help unleash the rapid development of AI products and services by enabling empowering non-experts to leverage powerful deep learning methods.

The techniques for evolving deep learning architectures developed through this project are naturally extensible to many problem domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and game-playing agents.
I plan to work with undergraduate researchers to demonstrate applications of such evolved networks showcase their work through interactive web media aimed at the general public.
The appealing and concrete nature of these application areas will help us to recruit from a broad spectrum of undergraduate students.
I will pursue support through the NSF BEACON Center, which places dozens of underrepresented undergraduate students into evolution-focused research laboratories every summer, for an undergraduate research assistant.
