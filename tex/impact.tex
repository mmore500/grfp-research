\section{Broader Impacts}

I aim to \textbf{make powerful deep learning methods accessible to non-experts} by reducing the computational cost of evolving deep learning architectures through NGS.
Partnering with industry will enable my work to help solve real-world problems by removing barriers to the development of new AI products and services.

I plan to \textbf{work with undergraduate researchers to demonstrate applications of deep learning architectures evolved with NGS} in natural language processing, computer vision, and game-playing agents and \textbf{create interactive web media to showcase their work to the general public}.
The appealing and concrete nature of these application areas will help us to recruit from a broad spectrum of undergraduate students.
I will pursue \textbf{funding through NSF BEACON}, which places dozens of underrepresented undergraduate students into evolution-focused research laboratories every summer.
