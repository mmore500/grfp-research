In addition to porting existing neurobiological theory, NGS, to an applied machine learning context, this research will characterize a novel model of developmental plasticity.
The role of plasticity in evolutionary theory is central to debate over the controversial Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.\autocite{Laland2014DoesRethink}
Results describing the relationship between developmental plasticity and evolvability will directly inform these important ongoing conversations.
Additionally, the NGS experimental framework will be made available for broader experimental investigation of the interplay between developmental plasticity and evolution through the Modular Agent Based Evolution Framework, which enables easy plug-and-play reuse of framework components by other researchers and citizen-scientist enthusiasts.\autocite{Hintze2017Mabe}
