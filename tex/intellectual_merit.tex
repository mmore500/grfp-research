\section{Intellectual Merit}
This Contribute to ongoing discussion of XXXX in the EANN community, in particular the question raised by Clune et al \cite{Clune2011OnRegularity}. and proposes a unique way of thinking of a link between learning --- as proposed by the Baldwin effect --- and irregular refinement as proposed by \cite{Clune2011OnRegularity}

EANN research draws heavily from the disciplines of neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and, of course, computer science. Thus, experimental results and theoretical advances from EANN are of interest to a huge community of researchers beyond (and much larger than) those explicitly dedicated to Bio-AI; EANN research offers significant potential to cross-pollinate ideas between these fields \cite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable, MoczekTheInnovation, MouretImportingGanglia}. Experimental results of this project, in particular, will be pertinent to evolutionary biology, which is grappling with the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution theory --- among other a handful of other contentious questions --- as it undergoes a paradigm shift in evolution theory from the Modern Synthesis to the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES) \cite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}. Study of the evolutionary bias induced by models of phenotypic plasticity that differ in search naivety and the maximum phenotypic distance traversed during search has the potential to directly inform important conversations in the evolutionary biology.

%   \item implications to broad questions of learning in EANN, the ultimate goal is to develop plastic EANN capable of on-line modification
%   \item 
%   \item interdisciplinary: bridge gap between evolutionary biology and computer science
%   \item advances in EANN can bridge back to inform/expand our understanding of the evolutionary process \cite{MoczekTheInnovation} \cite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable} and emergent intelligence (i.e. neuroscience) in vivo
%   \item ``Extended Evolutionary Synthesis'' ``The broader context is that evolvability will constitute one of the foundational blocks for the much anticipated (or dreaded) EES in evolutionary biology93, together with other concepts that are new to — and yet build upon the achievements of — the Modern Synthesis. This expan- sion will include the role of phenotypic and behavioural plasticity 4,7, a better understanding of the evolution of develop- ment8–13, the role of epigenetic inheritance systems94, the idea of genetic accommoda- tion7, the dynamics of evolution in highly dimensional adaptive landscapes57, and of course the wealth of information provided by the post-genomic era95. It is an exciting moment to be an evolutionary biologist.'' \cite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}
%   \item The Baldwin effect postulates that network plasticity can pave the way for heritable variation \cite{Downing2009ComputationalEffect}
%   \item Baldwin effect and learning: the most naive version; how much sophistication is required in the learning process to observe this effect
