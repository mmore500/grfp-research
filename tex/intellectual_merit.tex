\section{Intellectual Merit}
My research will introduce a \textbf{novel bio-inspired machine learning technique}, paving the way for continuing advances in bio-AI.
In addition, my experimental results describing the relationship between developmental plasticity and evolvability will \textbf{directly inform debate among evolutionary biologists} over the controversial Extended Evolutionary Synthesis \cite{Laland2014DoesRethink}.
I will use the Modular Agent Based Evolution Framework \cite{Hintze2017Mabe} for my exploratory experiments to enable \textbf{easy plug-and-play reuse} of software components by other researchers for \textbf{further experiments investigating the interplay between plasticity and evolution}.
