\section{Intellectual Merit}
By considering irregular refinement as a model of learning, this research applies an existing toolkit (based on the work of Clune et al.) to probe a poorly characterized theoretical construct: the Baldwin effect; it represents a novel link between to previously separate lines of EANN research \autocite{Clune2011OnRegularity,Downing2010TheNetworks}.
Further, this research has the potential to inform current efforts to understand what characteristics make neural architectures amenable to learning (both via local learning rules and backpropagation) and to develop methodology to evolve those network configurations.

Given the interdisciplinary nature of EANN research, experimental results of this project will be of interest to a wide variety scholarly circles.
It is especially pertinent to evolutionary biology, which is grappling with the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution theory (among several contentious issues) as it undergoes a paradigm shift in evolution theory from the Modern Synthesis to the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis\autocite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}.
Results describing evolutionary bias induced by representative and elitist models of phenotypic plasticity will directly inform these important conversations.


% \begin{itemize}
%   \item implications to broad questions of learning in EANN, the ultimate goal is to develop plastic EANN capable of on-line modification
%   \item
%   \item interdisciplinary: bridge gap between evolutionary biology and computer science
%   \item advances in EANN can bridge back to inform/expand our understanding of the evolutionary process \autocite{MoczekTheInnovation} \autocite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable} and emergent intelligence (i.e. neuroscience) in vivo
%   \item ``Extended Evolutionary Synthesis'' ``The broader context is that evolvability will constitute one of the foundational blocks for the much anticipated (or dreaded) EES in evolutionary biology93, together with other concepts that are new to — and yet build upon the achievements of — the Modern Synthesis.
% This expan- sion will include the role of phenotypic and behavioural plasticity 4,7, a better understanding of the evolution of develop- ment8–13, the role of epigenetic inheritance systems94, the idea of genetic accommoda- tion7, the dynamics of evolution in highly dimensional adaptive landscapes57, and of course the wealth of information provided by the post-genomic era95.
% It is an exciting moment to be an evolutionary biologist.'' \autocite{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable}
%   \item The Baldwin effect postulates that network plasticity can pave the way for heritable variation \autocite{Downing2009ComputationalEffect}
