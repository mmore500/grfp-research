\section{Intellectual Merit}
My research will introduce a \textbf{novel bio-inspired machine learning technique}, paving the way for continuing advances in bio-AI.
In addition, my experimental results describing the relationship between developmental plasticity and evolvability will \textbf{directly inform debate among evolutionary biologists} over the controversial Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.\autocite{Laland2014DoesRethink}
I will use the Modular Agent Based Evolution Framework for my exploratory experiments to enable \textbf{easy plug-and-play reuse} of NGS framework components by other researchers and citizen-scientist enthusiasts for \textbf{further experiments investigating the interplay between plasticity and evolution}.\autocite{Hintze2017Mabe}
