\section{Expected Results}
Observation of evolutionary pressure for irregular refinement potential among any of the three trials would suggest that the local phenotypic environment is indicative of irregular refinement potential. The exact characteristics of local phenotypic space tied to irregular refinement potential would depend on the trial(s) in which the evolutionary bias is observed. On the other hand, seeing no effect of phenotypic plasticity on evolutionary bias towards irregular refinement potential would indicate that this potential is not a function of local phenotype space characteristics, but might instead be associated with macro properties of the phenotypic space. Further work would be warranted to explore that possibility and, if promising, develop a scheme to select for macro properties of a phenotypic region.
