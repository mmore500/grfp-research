\section{Expected Results}

Small scale experiments

Assessing ability of network to adapt to irregular vs regular problem domains
Experiments will be replicated at varying levels of problem regularity  domains (each designed to permit manipulation of problem regularity): target weights, bit mirroring, and quadruped control.\autocite{Clune2011OnRegularity}

These experiments will also be interesting to Alife/biologists as they can be interpreted as reflecting on the ability of neural darwinism to enable irregular architectural refinement.

Large scale experiments

Assessing ability of network to achieve benchmarks in comparison to other state-of-the-art manually designed networks and, in particular, to existing evolutionary methods.
The CFAIR-10 benchmark, for which performance is reported in [Google] and [Sentient] will be used.
