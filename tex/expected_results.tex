\section{Expected Results}
Observation of evolutionary pressure for irregular refinement potential among would suggest that the local phenotypic environment is predictive of irregular refinement potential.
If the elitist local search scheme yields solutions with high irregular refinement potential, then irregular refinement potential of an individual would ostensibly be correlated with phenotypes that are proximal to higher-fitness peaks in the phenotype space.
Similarly, evolution of solutions with high irregular refinement potential by the representative local search scheme would indicate that irregular refinement potential is correlated with phenotypes that have uniformly highly-fit neighbors.
Observing no effect of phenotypic plasticity on evolutionary bias towards irregular refinement potential would suggest that this potential might instead be associated with macro properties of the phenotype space, a possibility that would warrant further investigation.
