\section{Expected Results}
If the 50th percentile and naive search is more effective, this would suggest that a representative characterization of the effect of irregularization on the ; if 100th percentile and simulated annealing search is more effective, then this would suggest that knowing the best possible result in the local phenotypic space is more important. Either of these results would suggest that learning potential might be guaged indirectly and at less computational expense. If neither is effective, then this would suggest that local phenotypic information is not adequate to characterize the potential of a phenotype for irregular enhancement and that efforts to learning rules into the evolutionary process
