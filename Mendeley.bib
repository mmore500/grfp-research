@article{Pigliucci2008IsEvolvable,
abstract = {In recent years, biologists have increasingly been asking whether the ability to evolve — the evolvability — of biological systems, itself evolves, and whether this phenomenon is the result of natural selection or a by-product of other evolutionary processes. The concept of evolvability, and the increasing theoretical and empirical literature that refers to it, may constitute one of several pillars on which an extended evolutionary synthesis will take shape during the next few years, although much work remains to be done on how evolvability comes about.},

@article{Mengistu2016EvolvabilityIt,
abstract = {One hallmark of natural organisms is their significant evolv-ability, i.e., their increased potential for further evolution. However, reproducing such evolvability in artificial evolution remains a challenge, which both reduces the performance of evolutionary algorithms and inhibits the study of evolv-able digital phenotypes. Although some types of selection in evolutionary computation indirectly encourage evolvability, one unexplored possibility is to directly select for evolvabil-ity. To do so, we estimate an individual's future potential for diversity by calculating the behavioral diversity of its immediate offspring, and select organisms with increased offspring variation. While the technique is computationally expensive, we hypothesized that direct selection would better encourage evolvability than indirect methods. Experiments in two evolutionary robotics domains confirm this hypothesis: in both domains, such Evolvability Search produces solutions with higher evolvability than those produced with Novelty Search or traditional objective-based search algorithms. Fur-ther experiments demonstrate that the higher evolvability produced by Evolvability Search in a training environment also generalizes, producing higher evolvability in a new test environment without further selection. Overall, Evolvabil-ity Search enables generating evolvability more easily and directly, facilitating its study and understanding, and may inspire future practical algorithms that increase evolvability without significant computational overhead.},

@article{Downing2010TheNetworks,
abstract = {The Baldwin Effect is a very plausible, but unproven, bio-logical theory concerning the power of learning to accelerate evolution. Simple computational models in the 1980's gave the first constructive proof of its potential existence, and subsequent work in evolutionary computation has shown the practical, computational, advantages of hybrid evolution-learning systems . However, the basic theory, particularly its second phase (involving genetic assimilation of acquired characteristics) is difficult to reconcile in systems controlled by neural networks, particularly those that arise from their genotypes via a complex developmental process. Our re-search uses new evidence of the blurred distinction between development and learning in natural neural systems as the basis for an abstract model displaying the Baldwin Effect in artificial neural networks that evolve, develop and learn.},

@article{Clune2011OnRegularity,
abstract = {This paper investigates how an evolutionary algorithm with an indirect encoding exploits the property of phenotypic regularity, an important design principle found in natural organisms and engineered designs. We present the first comprehensive study showing that such phenotypic regularity enables an indirect encoding to outperform direct encoding controls as problem regularity increases. Such an ability to produce regular solutions that can exploit the regularity of problems is an important prerequisite if evolutionary algorithms are to scale to high-dimensional real-world problems, which typically contain many regularities, both known and unrecognized. The indirect encoding in this case study is HyperNEAT, which evolves artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a manner inspired by concepts from biological development. We demonstrate that, in contrast to two direct encoding controls, HyperNEAT produces both regular behaviors and regular ANNs, which enables HyperNEAT to significantly outperform the direct encodings as regularity increases in three problem domains. We also show that the types of regularities HyperNEAT produces can be biased, allowing domain knowledge and preferences to be injected into the search. Finally, we examine the downside of a bias toward regularity. Even when a solution is mainly regular, some irregularity may be needed to perfect its functionality. This insight is illustrated by a new algorithm called HybrID that hybridizes indirect and direct encodings, which matched HyperNEAT's performance on regular problems yet outperformed it on problems with some irregularity. HybrID's ability to improve upon the performance of HyperNEAT raises the question of whether indirect encodings may ultimately excel not as stand-alone algorithms, but by being hybridized with a further process of refinement, wherein the indirect encoding produces patterns that exploit problem regularity and the refining process modifies that pattern to capture irregularities. This paper thus paints a more complete picture of indirect encodings than prior studies because it analyzes the impact of the continuum between irregularity and regularity on the performance of such encodings, and ultimately suggests a path forward that combines indirect encodings with a separate process of refinement.},
